## Usage
To run the tests, run `npm run test`.

## Kata Rules
See the original [presentation](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata).

This kata demonstrates the power of doing tests first, and how up-front design decisions can change
and give way to a simpler implementation by coding iteratively.

Write a `BowlingGame` object with methods `roll(pins)` and `getScore()`.

This will be the game engine which follows the rules of bowling:

* The game consists of 10 frames, in each frame the player has the ability to knock down 10 pins.
* The score for the frame is the total number of pins knocked down + bonuses for `strikes` and 
`spares`.
* A `spare` is when the player knocks down all 10 pins in 2 tries. The bonus for a spare is the 
next roll.
* A `strike` is when the player knocks down all 10 pins in 1 try. The bonus is the next 2 rolls.
* In the tenth frame a player who rolls a spare / strike gets an extra roll(s) to complete the 
frame.
* No more than 3 rolls can be rolled in the 10th frame.




## Greeter

#### Before you start:
* **Try not to read ahead.**
* **Do one task at a time. The trick is to learn to work incrementally.**

This kata demonstrates the problems of static scoped functions and objects.

All tests should always pass, regardless of environment conditions.

1. Write a `Greeter` class with `greet` function that receives a `name` as input and outputs `Hello <name>`. The signature of `greet` should not change throughout the kata. You are allowed to construct `Greeter` object as you please.
2. `greet` trims the input
3. `greet` capitalizes the first letter of the name
4. `greet` returns `Good morning <name>` when the time is 06:00-12:00
5. `greet` returns `Good evening <name>` when the time is 18:00-22:00
6. `greet` returns `Good night <name>` when the time is 22:00-06:00
7. `greet` logs into console each time it is called
